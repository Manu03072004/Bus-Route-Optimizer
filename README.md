# üöç Bus Route Optimizer for College Students

This project provides an interactive tool to calculate distances, fares, and visualize optimized bus routes between **cities** and **colleges** using the [OpenRouteService API](https://openrouteservice.org/).  
It displays the **map with route, markers, distance, and estimated fare** directly inside Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Features
-  Select a **City** and a **College** from dropdowns.  
-  Calculates **road distance** using OpenRouteService.  
-  Estimates **bus fare** (‚Çπ1.2 per km, minimum ‚Çπ10).  
-  Shows an **interactive map** with route, start & end markers.  
-  Adds intermediate **orange markers** with place names
